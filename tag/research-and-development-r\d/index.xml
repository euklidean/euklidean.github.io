      <title>Firm-level TFP and the Cross-section of Stock Returns (with Takashi Hiroki and Kentaro Iwatsubo)</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Contrary to the findings of previous U.S. studies, we show that the firm-level total factor productivity (TFP) of Japanese manufacturers positively predicts their future stock returns in the cross-section when controlling for relevant risk factors, including those of Fama and French (2015).  Risks related to intangible expenditure, primarily those for research and development (R&amp;amp;D) and personnel, explain a substantial fraction of the predictive power of firm-level TFP, while bankruptcy, macroeconomic and capital expenditure risks do not. More productive firms trade at a significant premium to less productive firms. This premium compensates investors for risks associated with innovation and organizational capital formation.&lt;/p&gt;
