  abstract         = {This paper investigates the advantages and challenges associated with synchronous and asynchronous activities in intercultural virtual collaboration (IVC) projects, particularly in relation to student satisfaction and learning outcomes. This study draws parallels between two distinct IVC projects. The first facilitated real-time interaction among students, lecturers, and peers from partner universities in the Netherlands and Japan. In contrast, the second project involved separate live classes led by local instructors in the Netherlands and Spain and featured asynchronous interactions among peers. This latter arrangement required students to exercise a greater degree of autonomy in their collaborative efforts. In both IVC projects, students developed a business case study that explored the influence of cultural factors on international marketing strategies. They participated in discussions and reflective exercises concerning the issue of greenwashing within the selected company. Our research employs data derived from students' final business case reports and satisfaction surveys. The surveys include both closed and open-ended questions to assess the effectiveness of the distinct IVC formats. Our research provides insights into the impact of the IVC formats on the student experience and learning. Findings indicate no substantial differences in the quality of work produced between the two formats; however, student satisfaction was notably higher in the synchronous model, highlighting that the way interactions are structured impacts the collaborative experience, even when final outputs are similar. This study offers important insights for educators navigating the challenges of virtual teaching and for policymakers looking to use digital technologies to foster a globally aware and responsible generation in an increasingly digital world.},
