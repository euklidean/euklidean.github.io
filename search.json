Global citizenship supports the transition to a sustainable society as the substantial and complex challenges facing the world transcend national borders. Global citizenship is a key response in contemporary higher education which aims to prepare students to address present and future challenges. We outline the design, international virtual collaboration, for an undergraduate course to develop students’ global citizenship competencies. International virtual collaboration works as an open-source instrument that provides an inclusive, equitable and low environmental impact solution to the internationalization of university students at home. We explain an iterative Participatory Action Research methodology to develop and enhance the present and anticipated positive societal impact of the course. The positive societal impacts include reduced environmental impact (by reduced need to travel), improved partnerships (by better understanding of cultural differences that may make working together across borders difficult), quality education (by improved educational design and approach), equality and diversity (by improved access, lower cost, for education that develops global citizenship competencies).\nKeywords: Higher education, Global Citizenship (GC), Intercultural competence, Intercultural Virtual Collaboration (IVC), Sustainability, Sustainable Development Goals (SDG)\nData: Data on student mobility for Japan."

    "title": "Have aluminium and copper futures markets become more volatile over time?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Within the industrial metals industry, there has been a great deal of interest surrounding trends in volatility over time. This paper uses a rolling AR(1)-GARCH(1,1) model to estimate and forecast the volatility processes for daily returns on the futures prices of two important non-ferrous metals, aluminium and copper.\nThe LME is the major international market for the main industrially-used non-ferrous metals, namely aluminium, aluminium alloy, copper, lead, nickel, tin, and zinc. Aluminium has the highest volume of spot and futures trade on the exchange, followed closely by copper. The two metals are also amongst the most important metals in an industrial sense.\nChanges in the prices of aluminium and copper are often closely aligned with changes in global industrial production, but also reflect market specific events, compliment and substitute relationships between the physical metals in production, and financial market type influences. Brunetti and Gilbert [1995] characterise two sources of volatility in non-ferrous metals markets, those related to financial market considerations and those related to market fundamentals. Financial considerations include information effects, speculative pressures and hedging activity, usually giving rise to short-run volatility effects. Market fundamentals refer to the underlying availability, supply and demand of physical metal. Fundamentals are a source of long term volatility in metals markets, primarily due to the lags involved in demand and supply side changes.\nIn this paper, the rolling model is used to examine how the processes driving aluminium and copper returns volatility have evolved over a long sample. Settlement price data on 3-month futures contracts traded on the London Metals Exchange (LME) is used to calculate the daily returns series. The sample consists of daily data for 3-month futures settlement prices in US dollars for aluminium over the period 1 October 1982 to 15 July 2005, and for copper over the period 5 January 1976 to 15 July 2005. The model is estimated using a rolling window of 1000 observations, which iterates 4671 times for aluminium, and 6448 times for copper.\nThe models are used to examine when and in what manner the α and β coefficients, as estimated parameters of the volatility process, change over time. Estimates are presented graphically. The α estimates for both metals indicate that short-run persistence varies in magnitude through each sample. Similarly, the β estimates also vary markedly over time. The long run persistence of volatility, α+β, is also non-constant over the sample. Moment conditions, specifically the second and fourth, are examined in order to evaluate the statistical properties of the empirical models. One-step-ahead forecasts are also generated and compared with a measure of the ‘true’ volatility, as defined by Pagan and Schwert [1990]. Several forecast evaluation criteria are also applied to the series of forecasts.\nThe results of the paper suggest that, while the volatility of returns does not appear to display an upward trend, relative to the 1980’s there are periods over the following years where the process driving time-varying conditional volatility appears to have become more variable, and to some degree harder to model at some times using a simple GARCH specification. The variation over time seen in the volatility process as modelled by GARCH suggests that, while volatility in returns has not necessarily increased, volatility in metals markets is itself volatile when analysed over a long horizon. Of course, instability in the GARCH model may indicate that a more complex volatility model is required to better reflect the volatility process in the data.\nKeywords: - Volatility forecasting, GARCH, Rolling models, Futures contract, Industrial metals"

    "text": "Keywords: Industrial metals, Cointegration, Commodities, Empirical finance, GARCH, Applied financial econometrics, Volatility, Cost-of-carry, Risk premium, Market index\nSummary: While futures markets for industrially-used metals have existed for a long time, their study increased in the academic finance literature from the 1980s as pricing in the metals industries moved from a producer-list basis to being exchange-referenced. By the early 2000s there was a substantial empirical literature on metals markets. Initially, I set out to evaluate what is known about the main industrially-used non-ferrous metals futures markets by examining the empirical significance of econometric modelling in the area. In the survey “Econometric modelling of non-ferrous metal prices”, which was co-authored with Michael McAleer and published in the Journal of Economic Surveys, we evaluate the empirical modelling in 45 prominent published articles. This was the first systematic evaluation of the empirical literature on metals futures markets and is my most cited article. Published empirical research was evaluated in light of the type of contract examined, frequency of data used, choice of both dependent and explanatory variables, use of proxy variables, type of model chosen, economic hypotheses tested, methods of estimation and calculation of standard errors for inference, reported descriptive statistics, use of diagnostic tests of auxiliary assumptions, use of nested and non-nested tests, use of information criteria and empirical implications for non-ferrous metals. The literature contains a number of conflicting results, for instance, on various aspects of market efficiency. We find that important empirical issues such as overlapping data, structural change, measurement error, correct use of proxy variables, non-stationarity and diagnostic testing are frequently ignored suggesting the empirical conclusions of much of the literature should be interpreted with caution.\nAn unanswered question in the literature was how futures contracts for metals are priced relative to the price in their spot markets. The two dominant theories for the pricing of commodity futures are the cost-of-carry and risk premium hypotheses. In “The Pricing of Non-ferrous Metals Futures on the London Metal Exchange” which was co-authored with Michael McAleer and published in Applied Financial Economics, we nested these hypotheses within a general model and tested between them in a cointegration framework. The modelling incorporated analysis of structural breaks and showed that structural change is important in determining the which futures pricing model describes the data best. The cost-of-carry model is generally superior, which implies that metals inventories are important in futures pricing. However, there are times when stocks are not important, and during these periods risk premia are important. This usually occurs when a metal’s price is on a long trend downward.\nMetals market participants have often been quoted in the financial media as claiming that the futures prices for industrially-used metals traded on the London Metal Exchange have become more volatile over time. They have argued that higher volatility has been a consequence of the move from producer-list pricing to exchange-based pricing and the financialisation of commodity markets (the increased participation of portfolio investors). There is some support in the literature for the claim that producer-pricing regimes produced less volatile prices, however this has been disputed by other research that suggests prices have not become more volatile and the results of work suggesting volatility increased are biased. In “How has volatility in metals markets changed?”, co-authored with Michael McAleer and published in Mathematics and Computers in Simulation, we use rolling GARCH models to analyse the time-varying properties of metals futures volatility estimates and forecasts over a long sample period. We show that markets have not become markedly more volatile over time, although during some periods volatility has been harder to model with standard specifications. The volatility process has become more complex and time-varying, while volatility itself has not tended to increase.\nExtreme or outlying observations are relatively common in financial returns and returns for commodity futures are no exception. Metals derivatives are sensitive to macroeconomic news and industrial production shocks in particular, global financial shocks, market specific supply shocks, and events such as the manipulation of the silver market by the Hunt Brothers and the copper market by Sumitomo Corporation. Extreme observations are deleterious to volatility models and their forecasts during uncertain times, when investors most need accurate forecasts. For instance, GARCH estimates become biased, moment conditions are violated and the model tends to over-predict the short-term persistence but under-predict the long-term persistence of volatility induced by extreme returns. In “Forecasting commodity market volatility in the presence of extreme observations”, joint with Michael McAleer (Proceedings of the International Congress on Modelling and Simulation, Volume 3: Socioeconomic Systems), we examine a straightforward and practically implementable method of accommodating extreme returns using a simple trimming regime applied to daily returns more than 2.5 standard deviations from a rolling mean. We find this method effective in improving the real-time volatility forecasts that practitioners use.\nIn “Related Commodity Markets and Conditional Correlations”, co-authored with Michael McAleer and published in Mathematics and Computers in Simulation, we examine the relationships amongst the volatility processes of industrially-used metals futures prices. We also examine how the volatility properties of London Metal Exchange Base Metals Index (LMEX), a price index for metals markets, reflect or differ from those of its constituent metals. We find that the short-run volatility effects between individual metals are more closely related than are the long-run volatility effects. This is largely because short-run volatility persistence is influenced by general financial market factors that have similar influences on the futures price of each metal. Long-run volatility persistence is metal specific as it is influenced by the fundamentals of each metal, such as consumption, production and inventory, as well as futures market liquidity. The volatility process of the LMEX is more closely related to the short-run rather than the long-run volatility components of its constituents."

Recent empirical studies on the information content of the yield spread have been conducted using simple linear univariate forecasting models. U.S. and G7 data have been found to support a leading association between the term structure of interest rates and changes in the level of future real economic activity. However, many of the econometric models presented in the literature are far from adequate; in particular, several empirical studies of the term structure have not adequately accounted for important explanatory variables.

The course provides students with an understanding of the roles of financial markets, how financial securities are priced and traded, and their role in the global financial system. We cover the financial system, interest rate determinsation, money markets, bonds, stocks, futures and options.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPortfolio Management (Investment)\n\n\nThis course is about investment and portfollio theory from a practitioner’s perspective. We cover risk and return, diversification, Modern Portfolio Theory, the Black-Litterman Model, investment philosophy, portfolio design, risk management, performance evaluation, ethics and fiduciary duty. We use these concepts to construct portfolios and examine portfolio anayltics in R using securities data from Nikkei NEEDS.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBehavioural Finance\n\n\nResearchers such as Daniel Kahneman, Amos Tversky, Robert Shiller and Richard Thaler pioneered the application of concepts from psychology to economic and financial decision-making. In behavioural economics and finance, we use principles from psychology to describe how individuals actually make economic and financial decisions, in contrast to the way rational agent models suggest individuals should make decisions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinance Data Workshop\n\n\nThis is an intensive workshop-style course that gives students hands-on experience in analysing and modelling financial data, and interpreting the results of analyses. Students will work with financial data from the Nikkei NEEDS database that is used by analysts in the finance industry. The course covers one topic in depth, such as factor analysis, panel regression or the Fama Macbeth model.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCrossing Borders Without Crossing Borders\n\n\nThis is an Intercultural Virtual Collaboration course. Students in Japan and the Netherlands work together in small teams on a business case project analysing the differences in marketing and communications related to the UN Sustainable Development Goals. The course aims to develop students intercultural competencies via learning by doing in a cross-border and cross-cultural context.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUndergraduate Seminar\n\n\nStudents write their undergraduate research paper under my guidance on a topic within the seminar theme ‘Empirical Analyses in Finance, Economics and Business.’ The course includes sessions on empirical research methods.

We cover applied econometrics and selective intermediate theory. Students will apply theory to empirical problems using economic and financial data in class and in assignments using the statistical programming language R and the RStudio IDE.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMacroeconomics\n\n\nThis course introduces advanced macroeconomic modelling techniques and their application to the the analysis of business cycle fluctuations. We cover the approaches to macroeconomic modelling and analysis, analyse the interrelationships between macroeconomic variables using vector autoregression, and examine the standard theoretical macroeconomic models with an emphasis on business cycles, inflation, monetary and fiscal policy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEconomic & Financial Crises\n\n\nWe will examine the salient features of crises in both emerging and developed economies and cover Hyman Minsky’s financial instability model. The course touches on economic history, international macroeconomics, international finance, banking, financial markets, regulation, government finances, international relations and politics. Students will develop a deep understanding of economic and financial crises, their causes and consequences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational Business\n\n\nThis is an introductory course in international business that examines the economic, management and commercial aspects of international businesses. We will take a global perspective, but also emphasise the perspective of Asian firms and doing business in Asia. Working through Asia-relevant case studies about international businesses is a key part of the course.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinancial Markets Workshop\n\n\nThis course will develop students’ skills in applying economic and financial theory to the real time analysis of macroeconomics, financial markets and investment strategy. The course is conducted in a workshop style. The class sessions be a combination of lectures given by me, student presentations and student led discussion. We will develop a strategy for interpreting and forecasting developments in financial markets and important economies, focussing on cycles and trends.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEconomics Readings in English\n\n\nThis course develops non-native English speaking undergraduates’ ability and confidence in discussing and comprehending economics in English. The course focuses on discussing economics related topics, not teaching the English language. Students are required to read, present and discuss various economics topics in English.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEconomic Development\n\n\nThis course covers the microfoundations of development. We examine theoretical and empirical issues applicable in less-developed economies. Topics surveyed include current issues, agriculture and rural development, education, human capital investment, employment and labour markets, population, poverty alleviation, health, credit and financial markets, dealing with risk, technological change, and project design and evaluation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational Trade\n\n\nThis course surveys a number of major issues in trade theory and policy, as well as empirical tests of trade models, in the light of recent developments in international economics. Through this course, students should become familiar with the theoretical models of international trade, current issues in trade policy, and application of the theory to less developed country economies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items"

    "text": "Keywords: Financial markets, Monetary policy, Information extraction, Analytical tools\nSummary: Central bankers have long recognised that financial markets contain useful information for macroeconomic surveillance and the conduct of monetary policy. Financial markets provide a valuable window for timely information on (domestic and global) economic and financial conditions. This is due to the vast amount of information aggregated by markets, to their forward looking nature, and to the fact that future asset returns are sensitive to economic conditions. Central bankers also pay close regard to financial markets because certain key markets are important initial linkages in the monetary policy transmission mechanism in many economies."

Forecasting recessions with the yield curve develops a model using publicly available interest rate data to forecast the probability of recession in the United States.

    "text": "Abstract: Contrary to the findings of previous U.S. studies, we show that the firm-level total factor productivity (TFP) of Japanese manufacturers positively predicts their future stock returns in the cross-section when controlling for relevant risk factors, including those of Fama and French (2015). Risks related to intangible expenditure, primarily those for research and development (R&D) and personnel, explain a substantial fraction of the predictive power of firm-level TFP, while bankruptcy, macroeconomic, and capital expenditure risks do not. More productive firms trade at a significant premium to less productive firms. This premium compensates investors for risks associated with innovation and human and organizational capital formation.\nKeywords: Firm-level productivity, Total factor productivity (TFP), Cross-section of returns, Intangibles, Research and development (R&D), Organizational capital, Japanese stocks\nSummary:\n\nWe show that firm-level TFP positively predicts future stock returns in Japan.\nThis result is robust even when controlling for relevant risk factors, including those of Fama and French (2015).\nThis finding is in contrast to those of previous studies in the U.S.\nRisks related to intangible expenditure, primarily those for R&D and personnel, explain a substantial fraction of the predictive power of TFP.\nThe premium on high TFP stocks compensates investors for risks associated with innovation and human and organizational capital formation.\n\n\n\n\n\nTFP has explanatory power for the future returns of Japanese manufacturing firms beyond the accepted stock risk factors."

How do large international firms communicate their commitment to sustainable development goals while promoting their products in different countries? What role does culture play in their adaptation of their messaging and marketing across countries?\nFor example, how do firms in different countries promote their commitment to reducing plastics pollution?\nStudents will work through a series of individual and teamwork guided tasks and reflection. that stimulate intercultural awareness in a business setting and build the business case. An important component of this course is boosting students’ cultural competence and ability to work effectively in international cross-cultural teams in a business setting."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Intertemporal asset pricing models, relating macroeconomic variables to asset returns and the term structure of interest rates, suggest that the term structure (yield curve) contains forecast-enhancing information about the future growth rate of real economic activity. Empirical evidence that the term structure contains information regarding a variety of macroeconomic variables has been presented in the literature over the last two decades. Recent empirical studies on the information content of the yield spread have been conducted using simple linear univariate forecasting models. U.S and G7 data have been found to support a leading association between the term structure of interest rates and changes in the level of future real economic activity. However, many of the econometric models presented in the literature are far from adequate; in particular, several empirical studies of the term structure have not adequately accounted for important explanatory variables. The purpose of the paper is to evaluate the significance of these empirical models. Published empirical research is evaluated in the light of the data used, choice of both dependent and explanatory variables, important omited explanatory variables, type of model chosen, economic hypotheses tested, methods of estimation and calculation of standard errors for inference (including generated regressors), reported descriptive statistics, use of diagnostic tests of auxiliary assumptions, use of nested and non-nested tests and information criteria, and empirical implications.\nKeywords: Asset pricing, Econometric modelling, Interest rates, Term structure, Forecasting"

    "text": "The analysis of commodity futures markets is an important field of empirical research in finance. A wealth of theoretical and empirical research has seen the development of models to analyse the properties of non-ferrous metals futures and forward prices. Several models use recent advances in the analysis of non-stationary data Particular attention has been paid to efficiency, risk premia and price behaviour of contracts on the major futures and forward exchanges for non-ferrous metals. Using results based on both futures and forward price data, the performance of models specifically developed for analysing the pricing of futures contracts or forward contracts are compared. The purpose of the paper is to evaluate the significance of the empirical models published in lending futures market journals since 1990. Published empirical research is evaluated in the light of the type of contract examined, frequency of data used, choice of both dependent and explanatory variables, use of proxy variables, type of model chosen, economic hypotheses tested, methods of estimation and calculation of standard errors for inference, reported descriptive statistics, use of diagnostic tests of auxiliary assumptions, use of nested and non-nested tests, use of information criteria, and empirical implications for non-ferrous metals.\nKeywords: Empirical models, Econometric critique, Futures, Industrial metals, Commodities, Metals"

    "title": "Carbon emissions markets: a simulation approach",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Since the advent of the Kyoto Protocol in 1997, increasing international attention has focused on the implications of anthropogenic climate change. In particular, consequences for the economy have dominated national debates in several industrialised countries. If the Protocol is ratified, industrialised nations will face a binding limit on their carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2-e),emissions of six greenhouse gases. National emissions quotas require countries to develop domestic emissions regulation, which, to a large extent, consist of emissions permit trading schemes. The Virtual Emissions Trading Program (VETP) is a simulation model that uses financial models to simulate a market for carbon emissions permits in which participants take on roles as emitters, sequesters, traders, and a regulator. Participants are required to meet emissions targets through investment and trading, with the object of maximising the value of their business within a given policy framework. A number of policy parameters can be manipulated to simulate various scenarios on the domestic rules which may govern a carbon constrained future. The model has implications for (i) greenhouse gas emission policy analysis; (ii) corporate strategy development for operations within a carbon constrained future; (iii) education in the economics of market mechanisms used in constraining carbon emissions; and (iv) generation of experimental data for academic research. This paper elaborates on the VETP model and its relationship to the complex and evolving policy environment surrounding a carbon constrained future. Preliminary results from a simulation conducted with industry participants are reviewed.\nKeywords: Climate change, Emissions trading, Kyoto Protocol, Market mechanisms, Environment, Experimental economics, Simulation"

    "text": "Recent industry development programs in several countries have involved the use of tradeable certificate schemes as means for electricity generators and retailers to fulfil mandatory requirements for renewable energy generation. Renewable energy generation will potentially also yield carbon offsets under domestic emissions constraints involving emissions trading schemes. This paper develops a novel framework for estimating the amount of renewable energy certificates and carbon emissions offsets that may be created by a wide range of small scale renewable energy systems. A methodology is developed that requires information on only two parameters of the generating system, namely the specific fuel consumptions of the renewable energy system and an appropriate baseline system.\nKeywords: Renewable energy, Market mechanisms, Emissions trading, Modelling"

This paper uses a rolling AR(1)-GARCH(1,1) model to estimate and forecast the volatility processes for daily returns on the futures prices of two important non-ferrous metals, namely aluminium and copper. The rolling models are used to examine how the processes driving aluminium and copper returns volatility have evolved over a long sample. The variation over time seen in the volatility processes, as modelled by GARCH, suggest that, while volatility in returns has not necessarily increased, the conditional volatility process in metals markets is itself time-varying when analysed over a long horizon.\nKeywords: Volatility forecasting, GARCH, Rolling models, Futures contracts, Industrial metals, Commodities, Metals"

We find that foreign investors have the greatest influence over the efficient price in the gold market, domestic retail investors in the gasoline market and domestic investment funds in the platinum and rubber markets. Differences in the relative influence of investor groups over commodity futures are likely to reflect the degree of contract homogeneity and associated market liquidity. Foreign (domestic retail) investors have larger information shares for the homogeneous liquid (heterogeneous illiquid) contracts than for the heterogeneous illiquid (homogeneous liquid) contracts.\nKeywords: Asymmetric information, Commodities, Futures, Investor behaviour, Market microstructure"

However, whether arbitrage opportunity leads to an increase or decrease in liquidity depends on the cause of the deviation. A demand shock leads to greater liquidity, while asymmetric information is toxic to liquidity. We examine how arbitrage and liquidity influence each other in the world’s largest platinum futures markets on exchanges in New York and Tokyo. The markets provide an interesting institutional setting because the futures are based on an identical underlying commodity but exhibit different liquidity characteristics both intraday and over their lifespans. Using intraday data, we find that deviation in currency-adjusted futures prices leads, on average, to an immediate increase in liquidity, suggesting that demand shocks are the dominant driver of arbitrage opportunities. Less actively traded futures experience a greater liquidity effect. Arbitrageurs improve liquidity in both New York and Tokyo by acting as discretionary liquidity traders and cross-sectional market-makers.\nKeywords: Arbitrage, Commodities, Efficiency, Futures, Liquidity, Market integration, Market microstructure, Platinum\nSummary:\n\nUsing intraday data, we find that deviation in currency-adjusted futures prices leads, on average, to an immediate increase in liquidity, suggesting that demand shocks are the dominant driver of arbitrage opportunities.\nLess actively traded futures experience a greater liquidity effect.\nArbitrageurs improve liquidity in both New York and Tokyo by acting as discretionary liquidity traders and cross-sectional market-makers.\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneralised implulse response functions showing the response of the platinum futures contract relative bid-ask spread in Tokyo to a shock in arbitrage profits between NYMEX and TOCOM."
