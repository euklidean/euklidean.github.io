Whether arbitrage opportunity leads to an increase or decrease in liquidity depends on the reason the price difference between the two markets has arisen. A demand shock leads to greater liquidity while asymmetric information is toxic to liquidity.

We examine how foreign investors contribute to efficiency. We model the influence of domestic and foreign investors' trades on the efficient price of Japanese stocks over 39 years.

The company sourced a specialised raw construction material from suppliers all over the world for customers in Asia. Our competitive advantage came from packaging the commodity with certain services, and our superior knowledge of the commodity. We managed client relationships intensely and considered both our customers and our suppliers as clients of our services. We also marketed to architects who were not our direct clients. Architects have a close relationship with developers and determine the materials used for a building.

Our analysis indicates that both platinum and gold markets in Tokyo are dominated by uninformed trading, while there is evidence supporting both uninformed and informed trading in New York. Separating global trading hours into Tokyo, London and New York day sessions, we also find that uninformed trading is more prevalent during the Tokyo day session while informed trading dominates the New York day session for both metals in both locations. This evidence suggests that futures markets for the same underlying commodity on different exchanges have different microstructure characteristics, while both informed and uninformed traders choose when to trade depending on market characteristics in different time zones.","tags":["Commodity futures","Cross-market analysis","Efficiency","Intraday seasonality","Market microstructure"],"title":"Intraday seasonality in efficiency, liquidity, volatility and volume: Platinum and gold futures in Tokyo and New York","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1527465600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1527465600,"objectID":"1216dc3c3bda2f31f672b002b4f8c81f","permalink":"/talk/who-influences-the-fundamental-value-of-commodity-futures-in-japan-hkust/","publishdate":"2018-05-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/who-influences-the-fundamental-value-of-commodity-futures-in-japan-hkust/","section":"event","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Who Influences the Fundamental Value of Commodity Futures in Japan?

This paper uses a rolling AR(1)-GARCH(1,1) model to estimate and forecast the volatility processes for daily returns on the futures prices of two important non-ferrous metals, namely aluminium and copper. The rolling models are used to examine how the processes driving aluminium and copper returns volatility have evolved over a long sample. The variation over time seen in the volatility processes, as modelled by GARCH, suggest that, while volatility in returns has not necessarily increased, the conditional volatility process in metals markets is itself time-varying when analysed over a long horizon.","tags":["Volatility forecasting","GARCH","Rolling models","Futures contracts","Industrial metals","Commodities","Metals"],"title":"How has volatility in metals markets changed?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Clinton Watkins"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1186963200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1186963200,"objectID":"7735e48474b56f2cc955c9c53cde20b1","permalink":"/publication/conf-paper/2007-bnm-financial-market-information-monetary-policy/","publishdate":"2007-08-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/conf-paper/2007-bnm-financial-market-information-monetary-policy/","section":"publication","summary":"Central  bankers  have  long  recognised  that  financial  markets  contain  useful  information  for  macroeconomic surveillance and the conduct of monetary policy.

In this study, data on 3-month futures contracts for aluminium, aluminium alloy, copper, lead, nickel, tin, and zinc are analysed. The risk premium hypothesis and the cost-of-carry model are the standard theoretical models for pricing futures contracts, but these two models have rarely been estimated within a unified framework for metals futures. Single equation versions of the risk premium hypothesis and the cost-of-carry model are nested within a more general model. If the spot price, futures price, interest rate, and stock level variables contain stochastic trends, long run versions of the general model can be estimated within a cointegration framework. Various long run pricing models are estimated using daily LME price data for the period 1 February 1986 to 30 September 1998. Likelihood ratio tests are used to test restrictions on the general model to examine the validity of alternative nested specifications.","tags":["Cost-of-carry","Risk premium hypothesis","Cointegration","Futures contracts","Industrial metals","Commodities","Metals"],"title":"Pricing of non-ferrous metals futures on the London Metal Exchange","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1133827200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1133827200,"objectID":"2f982641037a69392a4ea31351b879dc","permalink":"/talk/have-aluminium-and-copper-futures-markets-become-more-volatile-over-time/","publishdate":"2005-12-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/have-aluminium-and-copper-futures-markets-become-more-volatile-over-time/","section":"event","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Have aluminium and copper futures markets become more volatile over time?","type":"event"},{"authors":["Clinton Watkins","Michael McAleer"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1133395200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1133395200,"objectID":"0f7b379f16faf93824ce30aa4ec6fe88","permalink":"/publication/conf-paper/2005-modsim-aluminium-copper-futures-volatility/","publishdate":"2005-12-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/conf-paper/2005-modsim-aluminium-copper-futures-volatility/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Have aluminium and copper futures markets become more volatile over time?","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1126742400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1126742400,"objectID":"e8d4cddf794c251d060f32e726b9af0a","permalink":"/talk/investment-and-natural-gas-markets/","publishdate":"2005-09-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/investment-and-natural-gas-markets/","section":"event","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Investment and Natural Gas Markets","type":"event"},{"authors":["Clinton Watkins","Michael McAleer"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1110844800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1110844800,"objectID":"55297646073f5cb9080a6ca831618f0f","permalink":"/publication/journal-article/2005-matcom-related-commodity-markets-conditional-correlations/","publishdate":"2005-03-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/journal-article/2005-matcom-related-commodity-markets-conditional-correlations/","section":"publication","summary":"Related commodity markets have two characteristics (i) they may be expected to follow similar volatility processes; (ii) such markets are frequently represented by a market aggregate or index.

In view of the likelihood of binding carbon constraints on developed nations, efficient interaction based on comparative advantage between economies via market mechanisms is considered essential for least-cost greenhouse gas abatement.Recent research has indicated that the major medium-term impacts of global and domestic carbon abatement policies on the Australian economy will be through changes in international trade flows. However, there has been little investigation of structural changes in trade relationships with major trading partners. Trade effect swill, to a  large extent, depend on the interaction of domestic carbon abatement policies through bilateral and multilateral mechanisms.

 industry  development  programs  in  several  countries  have  involved  the  use  of  tradeable  certificate  schemes  as  means  for  electricity  generators  and  retailers  to  fulfil  mandatory  requirements  for  renewable  energy  generation.  Renewable  energy  generation  will  potentially  also  yield  carbon  offsets  under  domestic emissions constraints involving emissions trading schemes. This paper develops a novel framework for estimating the amount of renewable energy certificates and carbon emissions offsets that may be created by a wide range of small scale renewable energy systems. A methodology is developed that requires information on  only  two  parameters  of  the  generating  system,  namely  the  specific  fuel  consumptions  of  the  renewable  energy system and an appropriate baseline system.","tags":["Renewable energy","Market mechanisms","Emissions trading","Modelling"],"title":"Estimating tradeable certificates created by small-scale renewable energy systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Clinton Watkins","Michael McAleer"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1024876800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1024876800,"objectID":"3a78852e920d07a723300e267884abe8","permalink":"/publication/conf-paper/2002-iemss-time-varying-volatility-metals-futures/","publishdate":"2002-06-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/conf-paper/2002-iemss-time-varying-volatility-metals-futures/","section":"publication","summary":"Recently  the  modelling  and  forecasting  of  volatility  has  received  much  attention  in  the  literature.

London Metal Exchange (LME) is a centre for spot and futures trading in the main industrially-used non-ferrous metals. In this paper, the market for 3-month LME copper futures contracts is analysed. The risk premium hypothesis and the cost-of-carry (COC) model are the standard theoretical models for pricing futures contracts, but these two models have rarely been estimated within a unified framework for metals futures. Single equation versions of the risk premium hypothesis and the COC model are nested within a general model. If the spot price, futures price, interest rate and stock level variables contain stochastic trends, long-run versions of the general model can be estimated within the cointegration framework. The long-run pricing models are estimated using daily LME copper price data over the period 3 January 1989 to 30 September 1998. Likelihood ratio tests are used to test restrictions on the general model.","tags":["Cost-of-carry","Risk premium hypothesis","Futures contracts","Industrial metals","Commodities","Metals","Cointegration"],"title":"Cointegration analysis of metals futures","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1018828800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1018828800,"objectID":"ba5e05602ca64f130c2b23cc373cbda6","permalink":"/talk/an-overview-of-emissions-trading-systems/","publishdate":"2002-04-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/an-overview-of-emissions-trading-systems/","section":"event","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"An overview of emissions trading systems","type":"event"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1018828800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1018828800,"objectID":"74e156f2499bbb4e74cf1600d3b6d6dc","permalink":"/talk/virtual-emissions-trading-simulation-workshop-cse/","publishdate":"2002-04-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/virtual-emissions-trading-simulation-workshop-cse/","section":"event","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Virtual emissions trading simulation workshop (CSE)","type":"event"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1011052800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1011052800,"objectID":"2d861afa7ddb5090fad5bd4d1092d0cd","permalink":"/talk/an-overview-of-australias-greenhouse-response/","publishdate":"2002-01-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/an-overview-of-australias-greenhouse-response/","section":"event","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"An overview of Australia’s greenhouse response","type":"event"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1008374400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1008374400,"objectID":"db10a1ac9641d58b81573e924cf7ca0c","permalink":"/talk/carbon-constraints-emissions-trading-and-the-macroeconomy/","publishdate":"2001-12-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/carbon-constraints-emissions-trading-and-the-macroeconomy/","section":"event","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Carbon constraints, emissions trading and the macroeconomy","type":"event"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1007942400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1007942400,"objectID":"f205f3732e2514da77b5aacc80e1afb7","permalink":"/talk/carbon-emissions-markets-a-simulation-approach/","publishdate":"2001-12-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/carbon-emissions-markets-a-simulation-approach/","section":"event","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Carbon emissions markets: a simulation approach","type":"event"},{"authors":["Clinton Watkins"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1007942400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1007942400,"objectID":"d06944c2541e5d2b737700b8a021dd26","permalink":"/publication/conf-paper/2001-modsim-carbon-emissions-market-simulation/","publishdate":"2001-12-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/conf-paper/2001-modsim-carbon-emissions-market-simulation/","section":"publication","summary":"Since the advent of the Kyoto Protocol in 1997, increasing international attention has focused on the implications of anthropogenic climate change. In particular, consequences for the economy have dominated national debates in several industrialised countries. If the Protocol is ratified, industrialised nations will face a binding limit on their carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2-e),emissions of six greenhouse gases. National emissions quotas require countries to develop domestic emissions regulation, which, to a large extent, consist of emissions permit trading schemes. The Virtual Emissions Trading Program (VETP) is a simulation model that uses financial models to simulate a market for carbon emissions permits in which participants take on roles as emitters, sequesters, traders, and a regulator. Participants are required to meet emissions targets through investment and trading, with the object of maximising the value of their business within a given policy framework. A number of policy parameters can be manipulated to simulate various scenarios on the domestic rules which may govern a carbon constrained future. The model has implications for (i) greenhouse gas emission policy analysis; (ii) corporate strategy development for operations within a carbon constrained future; (iii) education in the economics of market mechanisms used in constraining carbon emissions; and (iv) generation of experimental data for academic research. This paper elaborates on the VETP model and its relationship to the complex and evolving policy environment surrounding a carbon constrained future. Preliminary results from a simulation conducted with industry participants are reviewed.","tags":["Climate change","Emissions trading","Kyoto Protocol","Market mechanisms","Environment","Experimental economics","Simulation"],"title":"Carbon emissions markets: a simulation approach","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1007942400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1007942400,"objectID":"426d9f7e77de4fc0e3e2360051e6dae9","permalink":"/talk/forecasting-commodity-market-volatility-in-the-presence-of-extreme-observations/","publishdate":"2001-12-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/forecasting-commodity-market-volatility-in-the-presence-of-extreme-observations/","section":"event","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Forecasting commodity market volatility in the presence of extreme observations","type":"event"},{"authors":["Clinton Watkins","Michael McAleer"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1007942400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1007942400,"objectID":"e70072c67b708b1e7fb058e5594a5cb2","permalink":"/publication/conf-paper/2001-modsim-commodity-market-volatility/","publishdate":"2001-12-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/conf-paper/2001-modsim-commodity-market-volatility/","section":"publication","summary":"Extreme observations in commodity returns time series data occur as the result of shocks to a market through macroeconomic news, or market-specific events including fundamental and speculative pressures. However, outliers can have a dominating and deleterious effect in empirical models. This paper examines the forecasting of returns volatility in the presence of extreme observations using an AR(1)-GARCH(1,1) model for a non-ferrous metal futures contract. A simple method of accommodating extreme observations is applied that involves squeezing outliers to various thresholds. The forecasts obtained using this method are compared with a simple model in which all observations from the sample are used, and no adjustment for atypical observations is made. Estimates from the rolling one-step ahead models are presented graphically, and a number of forecast evaluation criteria are used to compare the forecasts generated under different outlier regimes.","tags":["Extreme observations","Outliers","GARCH","Futures","Volatility","Metals"],"title":"Forecasting commodity market volatility in the presence of extreme

London Metal Exchange (LME) is a centre for spot and futures trading in the main industrially-used non-ferrous metals. In this paper, the market for 3-month LME copper futures contracts is analysed. The risk premium hypothesis and the cost-of-carry model are the standard theoretical models for pricing futures contracts, but these two models have rarely been estimated within a unified framework for metals futures. Single equation versions of the risk premium hypothesis and the cost-of-carry model are nested within a general model. If the spot price, futures price, interest rate and stock level variables contain stochastic trends, long run versions of the general model can be estimated within the cointegration framework. The long run pricing models are estimated using daily LME copper price data over the period 3 January 1989 to 30 September 1998. Likelihood ratio tests are used to test restrictions on the general model.","tags":["Cost-of-carry","Risk premium hypothesis","Cointegration","Futures contracts","Industrial metals","Commodities","Metals"],"title":"Estimating long run pricing models for copper futures prices","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":932947200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":932947200,"objectID":"4ef316e33e602a935d8900b2e15daaaa","permalink":"/talk/hybrid-renewable-energy-system-and-village-workshop-in-kemiri-irian-jaya/","publishdate":"1999-07-26T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/hybrid-renewable-energy-system-and-village-workshop-in-kemiri-irian-jaya/","section":"event","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Hybrid renewable energy system and village workshop in Kemiri, Irian Jaya","type":"event"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":881539200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":881539200,"objectID":"90d1634e6026d27f4e841601d8b6d558","permalink":"/talk/pricing-in-futures-and-forward-markets-for-non-ferrous-metals-an-empirical-critique/","publishdate":"1997-12-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/pricing-in-futures-and-forward-markets-for-non-ferrous-metals-an-empirical-critique/","section":"event","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Pricing in futures and forward markets for non-ferrous metals: an empirical critique","type":"event"},{"authors":["Clinton Watkins"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":881539200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":881539200,"objectID":"126e4ba5d362b15a8eb84f4a25bdac7d","permalink":"/publication/conf-paper/1997-modsim-empirical-critique-futures-pricing/","publishdate":"1997-12-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/conf-paper/1997-modsim-empirical-critique-futures-pricing/","section":"publication","summary":"The analysis of commodity futures markets is an important field of empirical research in finance. A wealth of theoretical and empirical research has seen the development of models to analyse the properties of non-ferrous metals futures and forward prices. Several models use recent advances in the analysis of non-stationary data Particular attention has been paid to efficiency, risk premia and price behaviour of contracts on the major futures and forward exchanges for non-ferrous metals. Using results based on both futures and forward price data, the performance of models specifically developed for analysing the pricing of futures contracts or forward contracts are compared. The purpose of the paper is to evaluate the significance of the empirical models published in lending futures market journals since 1990. Published empirical research is evaluated in the light of the type of contract examined, frequency of data used, choice of both dependent and explanatory variables, use of proxy variables, type of model chosen, economic hypotheses tested, methods of estimation and calculation of standard errors for inference, reported descriptive statistics, use of diagnostic tests of auxiliary assumptions, use of nested and non-nested tests, use of information criteria, and empirical implications for non-ferrous metals.","tags":["Empirical models","Econometric critique","Futures","Industrial metals","Commodities","Metals"],"title":"Pricing in futures and forward markets for non-ferrous metals: an empirical critique","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Clinton Watkins"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":857952000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":857952000,"objectID":"bebcd4570ac61e9cdd0cd0be7ec97a2e","permalink":"/publication/journal-article/1997-matcom-term-structure-interest-rates-economic-activity/","publishdate":"1997-03-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/journal-article/1997-matcom-term-structure-interest-rates-economic-activity/","section":"publication","summary":"Intertemporal asset pricing models, relating macroeconomic variables to asset returns and the term structure of interest rates, suggest that the term structure (yield curve) contains forecast-enhancing information about the future growth rate of real economic activity. Empirical evidence that the term structure contains information regarding a variety of macroeconomic variables has been presented in the literature over the last two decades. Recent empirical studies on the information content of the yield spread have been conducted using simple linear univariate forecasting models. U.S. and G7 data have been found to support a leading association between the term structure of interest rates and changes in the level of future real economic activity. However, many of the econometric models presented in the literature are far from adequate; in particular, several empirical studies of the term structure have not adequately accounted for important explanatory variables. The purpose of the paper is to evaluate the significance of these empirical models.","tags":["Interest rates","Yield curve","Economic activity","Empirical models","Econometrics critique","Forecasting"],"title":"The term structure of interest rates and economic activity: An empirical critique","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":817430400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":817430400,"objectID":"f8f24988486132e09ff9f7d9bad9c72f","permalink":"/talk/human-capital-and-screening-theories-of-education-an-empirical-critique/","publishdate":"1995-11-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/human-capital-and-screening-theories-of-education-an-empirical-critique/","section":"event","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Human capital and screening theories of education: an empirical critique","type":"event"},{"authors":["Clinton Watkins"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":817430400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":817430400,"objectID":"86e49311394742eab684610d8921f3d8","permalink":"/publication/conf-paper/1995-modsim-human-capital/","publishdate":"1995-11-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/conf-paper/1995-modsim-human-capital/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Human capital and screening theories of education: an empirical critique","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Clinton Watkins"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":817430400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":817430400,"objectID":"60b10eabd475dff6a2cb55e086fd382f","permalink":"/publication/conf-paper/1995-modsim-term-structure-interest-rates/","publishdate":"1995-11-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/conf-paper/1995-modsim-term-structure-interest-rates/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"The term structure of interest rates and economic activity: an empirical critique","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":817430400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":817430400,"objectID":"200b34067c9b81050cd781bfae63d8a3","permalink":"/talk/the-term-structure-of-interest-rates-and-economic-activity-an-empirical-critique-modsim95/","publishdate":"1995-11-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/the-term-structure-of-interest-rates-and-economic-activity-an-empirical-critique-modsim95/","section":"event","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"The term structure of interest rates and economic activity: an empirical critique (MODSIM95)","type":"event"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":776649600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":776649600,"objectID":"97e41518ff868ead9af6afd408a72e25","permalink":"/talk/the-term-structure-of-interest-rates-and-economic-activity-an-empirical-critique/","publishdate":"1994-08-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/the-term-structure-of-interest-rates-and-economic-activity-an-empirical-critique/","section":"event","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"The term structure of interest rates and economic activity: an empirical critique","type":"event"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"f26b5133c34eec1aa0a09390a36c2ade","permalink":"/admin/config.yml","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/admin/config.yml","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"wowchemycms"}]
